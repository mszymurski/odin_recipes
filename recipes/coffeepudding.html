   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant coffee granules</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon almond flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) salted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Kahlua (coffee liquor)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks</li>
   </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
<li>Position a rack in the lower third of the oven. Preheat the oven to 350Â° F.</li>
<li>Lightly butter an 8-9 inch deep skillet or pie plate.</li>
<li>Whisk together the eggs and sugar until well combined. Add the cocoa powder, instant coffee, almond flour, and salt. Whisk in the melted butter, Kahlua, and vanilla until smooth. Fold in the chocolate chips/chunks. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish.</li>
<li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the pudding is puffed on top, but still wiggly in the center. The longer you bake, the more set your pudding will be. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Serve the pie warm, with vanilla ice cream. Or chill and serve chilled with whipped cream or ice cream.</li>
    </ol>
<p><em><strong>Tips:</strong></em></p>

Baking Time: the baking time for this can vary, start checking your pudding around 25 minutes into baking. It should never be fully set on top. It should have a little wiggle to it.
